# dotfiles

This repository hosts my personal [dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory) and tools to bootstrap a new minimal operational environment.

## Disclaimer

This repository is meant for my personal usage, it includes my personal settings for my work environment on Mac OS X.

Donâ€™t blindly use this unless you know what you do. Use at your own risk ðŸ˜Š!

## How it works

The `bootstrap.sh` script installs all necessary programs and command line utilities, then it creates `symlinks` between the `dotfiles` stored in this repository and your `$HOME` directory.

Installed tools and scripts:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) - Mac App Store command line utility
- xcode
- [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
- all applications in `mas.txt`
- all applications in `brew.txt`
- all applications in `cask.txt`

## Requirements

A Mac OS X environment with ARM chip with Catalina or higher. (in [2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) Mac OSX default to `zsh`).

## Bootstraping a new Mac

To bootstrap a new environment follow these steps:

1. Sign to Mac App Store (necessary to install xcode and all applications in `mas.txt`)
1. Open a Terminal
1. Clone this repository: `$> git clone https://github.com/hervenivon/dotfiles`
1. `$> cd dotfiles`
1. Execute the bootstraping script: `$> sh ./bootstrap.sh`
1. Open `iTerm2` and follow the bellow instructions to finish the setup (color theme and fonts)

### Security alerts

Apple security prevents certain applications to be opened after an installation from Internet.

You might see the following

If that is the case, click "OK". Then open `Preferences` application and search for security.
