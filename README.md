# dotfiles

This repository hosts my personal [dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory) and tools to bootstrap a new minimal operational environment.

## Disclaimer

This repository is meant for my personal usage, it includes my personal settings for my work environment on Mac OS X.

Donâ€™t blindly use this unless you know what you do. Use at your own risk ðŸ˜Š!

## How it works

The `bootstrap.sh` script installs all necessary programs and command line utilities, then it creates `symlinks` between the `dotfiles` stored in this repository and your `$HOME` directory.

Installed tools and scripts:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) - Mac App Store command line utility
- xcode
- [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
- all applications in `mas.txt`
- all applications in `brew.txt`
- all applications in `cask.txt`

## Requirements

A Mac OS X environment

## Bootstraping an environment

To bootstrap a new environment follow these steps:

1. Sign to Mac App Store (necessary to install xcode and all applications in `mas.txt`)
1. Open a Terminal
1. Clone this repository: `$> git clone https://github.com/hervenivon/dotfiles`
1. `$> cd dotfiles`
1. Execute the bootstraping script: `$> sh ./bootstrap.sh`
1. Open `iTerm2`

### Security alerts

Apple security prevents certain applications to be opened after an installation from Internet.

You might see the following

If that is the case, click "OK". Then open `Preferences` application and search for security.

#### Terminal integration

With iTerm2 comes [shell-integration](https://iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html) which enable further features in iTerm2:

- Command status
- Download and upload with scp
- Command history
- Toolbelt enhancement
- Recent Directories

### Finishing Visual Studio Code setup

In order to finish Visual Studio Code setup, we need to gather all its settings. A wonderful extension named [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) is meant for that purpose.

1. Install [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync)
1. Get a token from GitHub that only enables gist creation (see Settings Sync for more details)
1. Once the extension is installed, download your settings: press *Shift + Alt + D*
1. Enter your GitHub Token (from (2))
1. Enter the GitHub Gist ID for the vscode settings
1. Settings Downloaded. You are Done! All your files are downloaded

### Others

Some other tools like Sketch required manual registration.

And now, you are good to go, cheers ðŸ¤“!
