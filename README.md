# dotfiles

This repository hosts my personal [dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory) and tools to bootstrap a new minimal operational environment.

## Disclaimer

This repository is meant for my personal usage, it includes my personal settings for my work environment on Mac OS X.

Donâ€™t blindly use this unless you know what you do. Use at your own risk ðŸ˜Š!

## How it works

The `bootstrap.sh` script installs all necessary programs and command line utilities, then it creates `symlinks` between the `dotfiles` stored in this repository and your `$HOME` directory.

Installed tools and scripts:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) - Mac App Store command line utility
- xcode
- [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
- all applications in `mas.txt`
- all applications in `brew.txt`
- all applications in `cask.txt`

## Requirements

A Mac OS X environment with ARM chip with Catalina or higher. (in [2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) Mac OSX default to `zsh`).

## Bootstraping a new Mac

To bootstrap a new environment follow these steps:

1. Sign to Mac App Store (necessary to install xcode and all applications in `mas.txt`)
1. Open a Terminal
1. Clone this repository: `$> git clone https://github.com/hervenivon/dotfiles`
1. `$> cd dotfiles`
1. Execute the bootstraping script: `$> sh ./bootstrap.sh`
1. Open `iTerm2` and follow the bellow instructions to finish the setup (color theme and fonts)

### Accept license agreement for Xcode

You'll have to accept the license agreement after the Xcode installation. It will be triggered after the first `git pull`.

### Security alerts

Apple security prevents certain applications to be opened after an installation from `brew` or Internet.

You will see the following

#### Terminal integration

- Command status
- Download and upload with scp
- Command history
- Toolbelt enhancement
- Recent Directories

### Finishing the setup

#### `gitservice` ssh key

- [Generate a new ssh key with a passphrase](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent):
  - `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"`
  - file name: `~/.ssh/gitservices`
  - passphrase: `<you choose>`
- [Update github ssh key with the public key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
  - `cat ~/.ssh/gitservices.pub`
  - copy the result to your clipboard
  - go to [github.com (create a new ssh key)](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new)
- `gh-ssh-add` (an alias to `ssh-add ~/.ssh/gitservices` added by the bootstrap script)

#### Visual Studio Code setup

1. Open the `Visual Studio Code` application (`code .` in `iterm2` for example)
1. Open the Account menu in the lower left corner and click "Sign In"
1. Activate Settings Sync
1. You are all set

#### Others

Some tools require further configuration, like Clean My Mac X - which requires a license.
